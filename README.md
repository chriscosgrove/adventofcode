Welcome to my repository for Advent of Code challenges! This repository contains my personal solutions and code for the Advent of Code puzzles.

## What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual event in December that consists of a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels. Participants can solve the problems using any programming language they prefer.
